This repository stores all CFD tutorials I completed and practice code I wrote to improve my programming skills.

The following structure explains the directories and their contents:
1. 12Steps_NS: 12 Steps to Navier Stokes CFD course by Prof. Lorena A. Barba
   a. Supplemented with changes and other files from DrZGan's Python CFD course
   b. Implemented personal touches wherever seemed fit
